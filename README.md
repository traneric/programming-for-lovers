# Programming for Lovers

## Course Overview
Programming for Lovers is a free, open online course project that launched in fall 2019.  For the first run of the course, I have given $2,500 to charitable causes in education and outreach that are organized by Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, where I serve as a teaching-track faculty member in the Computational Biology Department.

I want this course to be a refuge for learners who want to become strong programmers and who have found existing online materials lacking in rigor and fun.  I detail the themes for teaching this course in my manifesto.  The central theme of Programming for Lovers is that I teach programming as rigorously as I would in an offline course at Carnegie Mellon by focusing on fun applications of programming, in a language–neutral way.  The course currently uses Go as its primary language, but this is subject to change.

The course is very much still in progress and I would love to have you join our community of learners from around the world!  You can sign up at Canvas: https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/RKFKKP. After the initial run of the course, I plan to move it onto a more stable, long-term platform.  Stay tuned for more details.

In the meantime, you can use the following Table of Contents to find links to chapters from the course that I have made open.
